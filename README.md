# Characterizing the regulatory logic of transcriptional control at the DNA sequence level by ensembles of thermodynamic models

This work reports a toolset for automated production of ensembles of several thousand fits to data, filtering of fits lying within the uncertainty of _Drosophila melanogaster even-skipped_ expression data, and visualization of regulatory mechanisms producing a given expression pattern down to individual binding sites accordingly to available transcription factors.

A pre-configured Docker image to run the application is available on Zenodo (DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.16624325](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16624325)), along with the fits files (in the fits folder) used in this work. The main dependencies for the environment configuration are [neoParSA](https://github.com/zhlou/neoParSA), [transcpp](https://github.com/kennethabarr/transcpp) and [Boost library 1.60](https://www.boost.org/releases/1.60.0/). The use of the provided Docker image is encouraged.
